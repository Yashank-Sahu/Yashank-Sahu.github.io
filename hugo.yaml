          **Key Project:** Integrating Security into CI/CD Pipeline: A DevSecOps Approach
          This project uses a DevSecOps methodology to include security into the CI/CD pipeline. By automating security tests at several phases, it guarantees secure software development:OWASP Dependency-Check checks open-source libraries for vulnerabilities using SCA (Software Composition Analysis).SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Prior to deployment, SonarQube checks code for security flaws.Docker Security: Prior to deployment, Trivy checks Docker images for vulnerabilities.AWS EC2 powers the pipeline (SonarQube for static analysis, Jenkins for CI/CD). To identify problems early, security checks are performed automatically at every level. This method adheres to DevSecOps best practices and speeds up the delivery of safe software.

          **Key Project:** Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning in Python
          This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset, comparing classifiers like KNN,PSVM, NN, and CNN based on accuracy, time, and performance. Machine learning and deep learning reduce human effort in recognition tasks by mimicking human learning through neural networks. Handwritten digit recognition is challenging due to variations in writing styles. The goal is to develop a CNN-based model for digit recognition, which can be extended to letters and handwriting analysis in real-world applications like bank cheques and license plates.
