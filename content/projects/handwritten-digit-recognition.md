## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development and comparison of various machine learning models for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It evaluates classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Polynomial Support Vector Machine (PSVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on accuracy, processing time, and overall performance.

The project addresses the challenge of variations in writing styles by employing machine learning and deep learning techniques to mimic human learning capabilities, thereby reducing manual effort in recognition tasks.

## Technical Details
The core of the project involved:
* Preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
* Implementing and training various classification models: KNN, PSVM, a simple Neural Network, and a Convolutional Neural Network.
* Evaluating each model based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Analyzing the trade-offs between model complexity, training time, and performance.
* The CNN model, built using TensorFlow/Keras, demonstrated the highest accuracy due to its ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features.

## Learnings
The primary goal was to develop a robust CNN-based model for digit recognition. This project provided valuable experience in implementing and comparing different machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and understanding the fundamentals of deep learning for image classification. The findings can be extended to letters and handwriting analysis in real-world applications such as bank cheques and license plates.
